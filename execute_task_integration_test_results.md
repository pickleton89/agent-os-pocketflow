- Framework standards and task requirements properly referenced
- Output enables quality-gated progression

**Blocking Validation**: ✅ PASS
- Critical blocking: "Fix identified issues before proceeding" 
- Re-validation until quality standards met
- Quality approval gates implementation progression

### Step 6.5: test-runner (Task-Specific Test Verification)

**Context Specification Compliance**: ✅ PASS
- `<context_to_provide>` block: Complete with test files, feature implementation, test framework configuration, naming patterns, acceptance criteria
- `<expected_output>` block: Test execution results, detailed failures, coverage metrics, performance metrics, fixing suggestions

**Information Flow Validation**: ✅ PASS
- Context includes implementation results from Step 5
- Output format supports completion verification
- Integration with Step 8 task completion clearly defined

**Focused Test Execution**: ✅ PASS
- Proper scope limitation to task-specific tests only  
- Skips full test suite appropriately (done in execute-tasks.md)
- Failure handling with debug and re-run capability

## Overall Integration Test Results

### Context Isolation Compliance: ✅ PASS
