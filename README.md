## Agent OS + PocketFlow Integration

**Production-ready system for intelligent LLM application development.**

This repository contains a **complete, production-ready integration** of [Agent OS](https://buildermethods.com/agent-os) with [PocketFlow](https://github.com/The-Pocket/PocketFlow), creating an intelligent development platform that transforms AI coding from documentation-focused (6.5/10) to workflow-enforced (9/10) structured development.

**Agent OS** (by [Brian Casel](https://buildermethods.com)) provides the structured workflow management, standards, and project organization that transforms AI coding agents from confused assistants into productive developers.

**PocketFlow** (by [The Pocket](https://github.com/The-Pocket)) provides the minimalist, graph-based LLM orchestration framework following the "Agentic Coding" methodology where humans design and AI agents implement.

### üéØ Integration Status: **PRODUCTION READY**

‚úÖ **All 4 Implementation Phases Complete** (75+ validation tests passing)  
‚úÖ **Comprehensive Setup & Validation System** (9-phase installation process)  
‚úÖ **Automatic Workflow Generation** (12+ files per PocketFlow pattern)  
‚úÖ **Design-First Enforcement** (Mandatory design documents with validation gates)  
‚úÖ **Cross-File Orchestration** (Intelligent dependency management)  
‚úÖ **End-to-End Testing** (Complete integration validation framework)

### ‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL: This IS the Framework Repository

**You are viewing the Agent OS + PocketFlow framework itself - NOT a project using it.**

| Framework Repository (This Repo) | Usage Repository (End-User Projects) |
|----------------------------------|-------------------------------------|
| üèóÔ∏è **We BUILD** the generator | üöÄ **They USE** generated templates |
| üîß **We CREATE** template systems | ‚úÖ **They IMPLEMENT** business logic |
| üìù **We WRITE** placeholder TODOs | üíª **They COMPLETE** placeholder TODOs |
| üß™ **We TEST** the framework itself | ‚úÖ **They TEST** their applications |
| üì¶ **Dependencies**: Template generation tools | üì¶ **Dependencies**: PocketFlow + runtime libs |

**Key Principle**: Missing implementations in generated templates are **features, not bugs**. This framework creates starting points for developers, not finished applications.

**Framework Development (this repo):**
- Improve generator logic in [`.agent-os/workflows/generator.py`](.agent-os/workflows/generator.py)
- Enhance validation scripts in [`./scripts/validation/`](./scripts/validation/)
- Develop the system that creates workflows for others
- Template placeholders and TODO stubs are intentional design features

**Framework Usage (your projects):**
- Where you install PocketFlow as a dependency
- Where generated templates become working applications  
- Where the orchestrator agent is useful for planning
- Where placeholder code gets implemented

> **New Contributors:** You're working on the meta-system that generates educational templates, not implementing those templates.

## Installation Guide

### Agent OS v1.4.0 Installation System

The Agent OS + PocketFlow framework uses a **two-phase installation system** that provides flexibility and self-contained project setups:

1. **Base Installation** (Optional but recommended) - System-wide standards and templates
2. **Project Installation** (Required per project) - Self-contained, committable project setup

### Phase 1: Base Installation

The base installation provides customizable standards and templates that can be shared across projects.

**Choose your AI development environment:**

```bash
# Agent OS with Claude Code support
curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/buildermethods/agent-os/main/setup/base.sh | bash -s -- --claude-code

# Agent OS with Cursor support  
curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/buildermethods/agent-os/main/setup/base.sh | bash -s -- --cursor

# Agent OS with both Claude Code & Cursor support
curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/buildermethods/agent-os/main/setup/base.sh | bash -s -- --claude-code --cursor
```

**What this installs:**
- Agent OS framework files to `~/.agent-os/` (or your chosen location)
- Customizable standards and templates
- Configuration file (`config.yml`) for project customization
- Base templates that project installations will copy from

**After installation:**
- Customize your standards in `~/.agent-os/standards/`
- Modify templates in `~/.agent-os/templates/`
- Configure preferences in `~/.agent-os/config.yml`

### Phase 2: Project Installation

Each project gets its own self-contained Agent OS installation that's committed to git and provides complete independence.

```bash
# Navigate to your project directory
cd your-project-directory

# Install Agent OS + PocketFlow for this project
curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/buildermethods/agent-os/main/setup/project.sh | bash
```

**What this creates:**
- Self-contained `.agent-os/` directory in your project
- No external references - completely independent
- Project-specific standards and templates
- PocketFlow workflow generation capabilities
- Claude Code agent configurations
- Committable to git for team collaboration

**Benefits of this approach:**
- **Team Collaboration**: `.agent-os/` directories are committable and shareable
- **Project Customization**: Different standards and templates per project
- **No External Dependencies**: Projects work independently of base installation
- **Version Control**: All Agent OS configurations are versioned with your code

### Verification

After installation, verify your setup:

```bash
# Check base installation (if installed)
ls -la ~/.agent-os/

# Check project installation
ls -la .agent-os/

# Test workflow generation (in project directory)
claude-code --workflow "Create a simple content analyzer using PocketFlow"
```

---

## Implementation Guide

### Creating Your First PocketFlow Application

Once installed, you can create intelligent LLM applications using the integrated workflow system:

#### 1. Design-First Development

All PocketFlow applications start with mandatory design documentation:

```bash
# The system will automatically create docs/design.md when you start a workflow
# This includes:
# - Problem statement and requirements
# - Architecture overview with Mermaid diagrams  
# - PocketFlow pattern selection (Agent, Workflow, RAG, etc.)
# - Implementation plan with validation criteria
```

#### 2. Generate Complete PocketFlow Implementation

```bash
# Use Claude Code to generate a complete PocketFlow application
claude-code --workflow "Create a content analysis system that processes documents and extracts key insights"

# This generates 12+ files including:
# - main.py (FastAPI app with PocketFlow integration)
# - nodes.py (PocketFlow nodes with type-safe implementations)  
# - flow.py (PocketFlow orchestration logic)
# - schemas/models.py (Pydantic validation models)
# - tests/ (Comprehensive test suite)
# - docs/design.md (Architecture documentation)
```

#### 3. Implementation Workflow

The system enforces a structured development process:

1. **Requirements Analysis** - Define what you're building
2. **Design Documentation** - Create `docs/design.md` with Mermaid diagrams
3. **Pattern Selection** - Choose optimal PocketFlow pattern
4. **Code Generation** - Auto-generate complete implementation templates
5. **Implementation** - Fill in business logic in generated templates
6. **Testing** - Run comprehensive test suites
7. **Validation** - Ensure quality gates pass
8. **Optimization** - Performance and reliability improvements

#### 4. Quality Gates

Every implementation includes automated quality assurance:

```bash
# The system automatically runs:
uv run ruff check .     # Code linting
uv run ty               # Type checking  
uv run pytest          # Test execution
```

### Common Development Patterns

#### Creating a Simple Agent
```bash
claude-code --workflow "Create a chatbot agent that answers questions about our product documentation"
# Generates: Agent pattern with single LLM integration
```

#### Building a RAG System  
```bash
claude-code --workflow "Create a RAG system that searches company knowledge base and provides contextual answers"
# Generates: RAG pattern with vector search and context injection
```

#### Complex Multi-Agent Workflow
```bash
claude-code --workflow "Create a content analysis pipeline with document processing, sentiment analysis, and report generation"
# Generates: Multi-Agent pattern with orchestrated sub-workflows
```
