> Status: Design Phase
> Framework: PocketFlow

**CRITICAL**: This design document MUST be completed before any code implementation begins.

## Requirements

### Problem Statement
Test workflow

### Success Criteria
- Successful implementation of WORKFLOW pattern
- All nodes execute correctly in sequence
- Proper error handling and validation
- Complete test coverage

### Design Pattern Classification
**Primary Pattern:** WORKFLOW
**Secondary Patterns:** FastAPI Integration (Universal)

### Input/Output Specification
- **Input Format:** Request data from API or direct invocation
- **Output Format:** Processed results with metadata
- **Error Conditions:** Validation errors, processing failures, timeout errors

## Flow Design

### High-Level Architecture
```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Start] --> B[Input Validation]
    B --> C[Processing]
```

### Node Sequence

## Utilities

Following PocketFlow's "implement your own" philosophy, specify all utility functions needed.

### Required Utility Functions


## Data Design

### SharedStore Schema
Following PocketFlow's shared store pattern, all data flows through a common dictionary.

```python
SharedStore = {
}
```

## Node Design

Following PocketFlow's node-based architecture, each processing step is implemented as a discrete node.


## Implementation Notes
