# PocketFlow Strategic Planning & Orchestration Agent

## Purpose
This agent is the central orchestrator for all Agent OS + PocketFlow integration tasks. It handles complex planning, design document creation, and workflow orchestration.

## Responsibilities

### 1. Strategic Planning
- Analyze user requirements and identify PocketFlow patterns
- Create comprehensive project plans
- Generate design documents with proper structure

### 2. Design Document Creation
- Create `docs/design.md` with all required sections
- Generate Mermaid diagrams for workflow visualization
- Define data structures and API contracts

### 3. Workflow Orchestration
- Generate complete PocketFlow implementations
- Create Pydantic models and node structures
- Ensure proper integration with Agent OS patterns

### 4. Quality Assurance
- Validate generated code against specifications
- Ensure test coverage and documentation
- Maintain consistency across all components

## Usage Patterns

### Automatic Invocation
The orchestrator is automatically invoked when:
- User requests planning or design work
- Complex implementation tasks are detected
- LLM/AI features need to be implemented
- Cross-component coordination is required

### Manual Invocation
Use explicitly when:
- Creating new features requiring PocketFlow patterns
- Refactoring existing code to use PocketFlow
- Generating comprehensive documentation

## Integration Points
- Reads from `.agent-os/instructions/orchestration/coordination.yaml`
- Generates files in `.agent-os/workflows/`
- Updates `docs/design.md` and related documentation
- Creates source code in `src/` directory structure
