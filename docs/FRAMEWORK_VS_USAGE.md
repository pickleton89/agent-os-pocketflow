# ðŸŽ¯ Framework vs Usage Statement

This repository IS the Agent OS + PocketFlow framework itself â€” NOT a project using it.

## Framework Repository (this repo)
- Generates PocketFlow templates for other projects
- Contains setup scripts, validation tools, and code generators
- Template placeholders and TODO stubs are intentional design features
- Dependencies support template generation, not application runtime

## Usage Repository (end-user projects)
- Where PocketFlow gets installed as a dependency
- Where generated templates become working applications
- Where the orchestrator agent runs and is useful
- Where placeholder code gets implemented

## Key Principle
Missing implementations in generated templates are features, not bugs. This framework creates starting points for developers, not finished applications.
