# Phase 2: Interactive Documentation Discovery Implementation Plan

> **Status**: Planning
> **Created**: 2025-01-12
> **Version**: 1.0.0
> **Framework**: Agent OS + PocketFlow v1.4.0

## Executive Summary

This plan outlines the implementation of an interactive documentation discovery system for the Agent OS + PocketFlow framework. The system will enable the framework to intelligently gather and utilize external documentation during product planning and spec creation workflows, significantly improving design accuracy and reducing implementation errors.

## Problem Statement

Currently, the Agent OS + PocketFlow framework generates templates and designs based on generic patterns without awareness of:
- Specific tech stack capabilities and constraints (React vs Vue, FastAPI vs Django)
- Company-specific coding standards or architectural patterns
- External API contracts that must be integrated
- Domain-specific requirements (compliance, security, performance)

This gap leads to:
- Generic designs that require multiple iterations
- Misalignment with actual framework capabilities
- Manual corrections for tech stack specifics
- Reduced efficiency in the design-first workflow

## Solution Overview

Implement a Phase 2 interactive documentation discovery system that:
1. Prompts users for relevant documentation during key workflows
2. Intelligently fetches and analyzes documentation
3. Enriches design and implementation with accurate technical context
4. Persists documentation references for future use

## Implementation Components

### 1. Documentation Registry System

#### File: `.agent-os/docs-registry.yaml`

**Purpose**: Central registry for all documentation references used by the framework.

**Structure**:
```yaml
# Auto-populated from user responses
version: 1.0.0
last_updated: YYYY-MM-DD

tech_stack:
  [framework_name]:
    type: "framework|library|tool"
    source: "URL or local path"
    last_fetched: "YYYY-MM-DD"
    relevance: ["list", "of", "relevant", "topics"]
    version: "framework version if applicable"
    
external_apis:
  [api_name]:
    type: "rest|graphql|websocket|custom"
    source: "URL or local path"
    spec_format: "openapi|swagger|custom"
    relevance: ["integration points"]
    
internal_standards:
  [standard_name]:
    type: "architecture|style|security|compliance"
    source: "local path or URL"
    relevance: ["applicable areas"]
    
compliance:
  [compliance_type]:
    type: "regulatory|security|industry"
    source: "documentation location"
    requirements: ["key requirements"]
```

**Implementation Tasks**:
- [ ] Create template file at `templates/docs-registry.yaml.template`
- [ ] Add registry initialization to setup scripts
- [ ] Implement registry validation logic
- [ ] Add version compatibility checking

   4. **Compliance & Security Requirements**
      Examples: HIPAA, SOC2, GDPR, security policies
   
   For each category you want to include:
   - Provide a URL to fetch documentation from, OR
   - Provide a local file path (starting with / or ~), OR
   - Type 'skip' to proceed without
   
   Format: [category_number]: [url_or_path_or_skip]"
</interactive_prompts>

<documentation_processing>
  FOR each provided documentation:
    1. Validate source accessibility
    2. Fetch content using appropriate handler
    3. Extract relevant patterns and constraints
    4. Store in docs-registry.yaml
    5. Include in planning context
</documentation_processing>
</step>
```

##### B. `/create-spec` Workflow Enhancement

**Location**: `instructions/core/create-spec.md`

**Enhanced Step 3: Requirements Clarification**
```xml
<documentation_discovery>
  <pattern_detection>
    ANALYZE spec requirements for technology mentions
    IF detected_technology NOT IN docs_registry:
      PROMPT: "I noticed you're using [TECHNOLOGY]. 
               Would you like me to reference its documentation?
               [URL/path/skip]:"
  </pattern_detection>
  
  <feature_specific_docs>
    Based on feature type, suggest relevant documentation:
    - Payment features → Payment provider docs
    - Auth features → Auth service docs
    - Data processing → Database/queue docs
    - UI components → Component library docs
  </feature_specific_docs>
</documentation_discovery>
```

**Implementation Tasks**:
- [ ] Modify plan-product.md to include Step 1.6
- [ ] Update create-spec.md Step 3 with documentation prompts
- [ ] Add pattern detection logic for automatic suggestions
- [ ] Implement progressive disclosure for documentation depth

### 3. Documentation Handlers

#### File: `instructions/core/documentation-discovery.md`

**New instruction file for documentation handling logic**:

```markdown
# Documentation Discovery Rules

## Handler Types

### URL Handler
- Use WebFetch tool with targeted extraction prompts
- Cache fetched content with 24-hour TTL
- Extract: API methods, patterns, constraints, examples

### Local File Handler  
- Use Read tool for local documentation
- Support markdown, text, and structured formats
- Watch for file updates if in project directory

### API Specification Handler
- Parse OpenAPI/Swagger specifications
- Extract endpoints, schemas, auth requirements
- Generate Pydantic models from schemas

### GitHub Repository Handler
- Fetch README and docs/ directory
- Index code examples and patterns
- Extract from specific tagged versions

## Processing Pipeline

1. **Validation**
   - Check source accessibility
   - Verify format compatibility
   - Validate version requirements

2. **Extraction**
   - Parse documentation structure
   - Extract relevant sections based on context
   - Identify code examples and patterns

3. **Analysis**
   - Map to PocketFlow patterns
   - Identify constraints and requirements
   - Extract best practices and anti-patterns

4. **Integration**
   - Update docs-registry.yaml
   - Enrich current workflow context
   - Generate pattern recommendations

5. **Caching**
   - Store processed documentation
   - Set appropriate TTL based on source type
   - Track version changes
```

**Implementation Tasks**:
- [ ] Create documentation-discovery.md instruction file
- [ ] Implement handler functions for each documentation type
- [ ] Add caching layer with TTL management
- [ ] Create extraction prompt templates for WebFetch

### 4. Context-Aware Integration

#### Enhancement Locations

##### A. Design Document Generation

**Files to modify**:
- `templates/pocketflow-templates.md`
- Design document sections to include documentation references

**Enhancements**:
```markdown
## External Documentation References

### Framework Documentation
- **[Framework Name]**: [Version] - [Documentation URL]
  - Key patterns utilized: [List relevant patterns]
  - Constraints considered: [List constraints]

### API Integrations
- **[API Name]**: [Version/Spec]
  - Endpoints used: [List endpoints]
  - Authentication method: [Method]
  - Rate limits: [Limits if applicable]

### Compliance Considerations
- **[Requirement Type]**: [Specific requirements addressed]
  - Implementation approach: [How requirement is met]
```

##### B. Task Generation

**File**: `templates/task-templates.md`

**Enhancements**:
- Include documentation links in task descriptions
- Add validation steps against documentation
- Reference specific documentation sections

**Implementation Tasks**:
- [ ] Update template files to include documentation sections
- [ ] Add documentation validation steps to task templates
- [ ] Create cross-reference system for easy navigation
- [ ] Implement version compatibility warnings

### 5. Smart Features

#### A. Pattern Detection

**Logic**:
```python
# Pseudo-code for pattern detection
tech_patterns = {
    "stripe": ["payment", "subscription", "checkout", "billing"],
    "auth0": ["authentication", "login", "jwt", "oauth"],
    "aws": ["s3", "lambda", "dynamodb", "sqs"],
    # ... more patterns
}

def detect_documentation_needs(spec_text):
    suggested_docs = []
    for tech, patterns in tech_patterns.items():
        if any(pattern in spec_text.lower() for pattern in patterns):
            if tech not in docs_registry:
                suggested_docs.append(tech)
    return suggested_docs
```

#### B. Progressive Disclosure

**Strategy**:
1. Start with high-level documentation (getting started, overview)
2. Drill down to specific sections as needed
3. Load detailed API references only when implementing
4. Cache frequently accessed sections

#### C. Version Management

**Features**:
- Track framework/API versions in registry
- Warn when documentation version differs from project
- Suggest documentation updates when versions change
- Maintain version-specific documentation cache

**Implementation Tasks**:
- [ ] Implement pattern detection algorithm
- [ ] Create progressive loading strategy
- [ ] Add version tracking and compatibility checking
- [ ] Build intelligent suggestion system

       3. Internal Standards
       4. Compliance Requirements
       
User: 1: https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/
      2: https://stripe.com/docs/api
      3: skip
      4: skip

Agent: [Fetches and analyzes FastAPI and Stripe documentation]
       [Creates product plan with accurate FastAPI patterns and Stripe integration details]
```

### Example 2: Creating a Feature Spec

```
User: /create-spec user-authentication

Agent: I noticed you're planning authentication features. 
       Would you like me to reference Auth0 documentation for best practices?
       
User: Yes, https://auth0.com/docs

Agent: [Fetches Auth0 documentation]
       [Creates spec with Auth0-specific implementation details]
       [Includes proper OAuth flows and security considerations]
```

## Conclusion

This Phase 2 implementation will transform the Agent OS + PocketFlow framework from a generic template generator to an intelligent, context-aware design assistant. By incorporating external documentation, the framework will produce more accurate, implementation-ready designs that require fewer iterations and align better with real-world technical requirements.

The interactive nature ensures user control while the smart features reduce manual work. The persistent registry creates a learning system that improves over time, making each subsequent project more efficient.

## Next Steps
