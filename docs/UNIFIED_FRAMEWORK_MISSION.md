# Unified Framework Mission Statement
## Agent OS + PocketFlow Integration

> **Vision**: Agent OS's excellent user experience and workflow orchestration combined with PocketFlow's powerful graph-based architecture to create a truly unified development framework.

---

## 🎯 Core Mission

Create a framework where **Agent OS serves as the conductor** (user interface, planning, orchestration) and **PocketFlow serves as the orchestra** (code structure, execution patterns, technical implementation). Every project that goes through the Agent OS workflow should emerge as a properly structured PocketFlow application.

### The Unified Philosophy

- **Agent OS** = How users interact, plan, and organize their work
- **PocketFlow** = How code is structured, executed, and maintained
- **Together** = One framework where excellent UX leads to excellent architecture

---

## 🔄 Current State Analysis

### What Works Well
- **Agent OS**: Excellent instruction framework (`/plan-product`, `/create-spec`, `/execute-tasks`)
- **Agent OS**: Clear planning → creating → executing strategy
- **PocketFlow**: Powerful Node/Flow architecture with design-first methodology
- **PocketFlow**: Clean separation of concerns through `prep→exec→post` pattern

### Integration Gaps
- **Parallel Systems**: Agent OS and PocketFlow operate as separate workflows
- **Conditional Integration**: PocketFlow only invoked for "LLM/AI components"
- **Architecture Mismatch**: Agent OS produces traditional code, not PocketFlow structures
- **Design Enforcement**: No systematic enforcement of PocketFlow's 8-step methodology

---

## 🚀 Desired End-User Experience

### Installation
```bash
# User installs the unified framework
curl -sSL https://example.com/install | bash
```

### Workflow (Unified)
```
1. /plan-product
   → Creates mission.md, roadmap.md
   → Automatically identifies opportunities for PocketFlow patterns
   → Sets up project for PocketFlow architecture

2. /create-spec  
   → Creates Agent OS spec files (spec.md, tasks.md)
   → ALWAYS creates PocketFlow design document (docs/design.md)
   → Enforces 8-step Agentic Coding methodology
   → Uses pattern-recognizer to identify optimal PocketFlow patterns

3. /execute-tasks
   → Generates PocketFlow-structured code (nodes.py, flow.py, utils/)
   → Uses dependency-orchestrator for proper package management
   → Uses template-validator for quality assurance
   → Result: Complete PocketFlow application, not traditional code
```

### User's Mental Model
Users don't see "Agent OS" and "PocketFlow" as separate systems. They see one unified framework that:
1. Guides them from idea to implementation
2. Always produces well-structured, maintainable applications
3. Follows best practices by default
4. Scales from simple workflows to complex LLM applications

---

## 🏗️ Technical Architecture

### Unified Instruction Flow

**Every Agent OS instruction should guide toward PocketFlow structure:**

```yaml
plan-product.md:
  - Identifies workflow opportunities
  - Sets PocketFlow as default architecture
  
create-spec.md:
  - ALWAYS creates docs/design.md (mandatory)
  - Enforces Requirements → Flow → Utilities → Data → Node design
  - Uses pattern-recognizer for optimal patterns
  
execute-tasks.md:
  - ALWAYS generates PocketFlow structure
  - Uses all PocketFlow agents systematically
  - Never generates traditional procedural code
```

### Agent Orchestration

**All agents work toward PocketFlow output:**

```yaml
Subagents (from Agent OS):
  - context-fetcher: Gathers requirements for PocketFlow design
  - file-creator: Creates PocketFlow structure (nodes.py, flow.py, etc.)
  - project-manager: Manages PocketFlow project lifecycle

PocketFlow Agents:
  - pattern-recognizer: Identifies optimal patterns (RAG, Agent, Workflow)
  - dependency-orchestrator: Sets up PocketFlow-compatible dependencies
  - template-validator: Ensures PocketFlow standards compliance
  - pocketflow-orchestrator: Oversees complete integration
```

### Generated Project Structure

**Every project follows PocketFlow conventions:**

```
generated-project/
├── docs/
│   └── design.md              # MANDATORY - 8-step methodology
├── main.py                    # FastAPI + PocketFlow integration
├── nodes.py                   # PocketFlow node implementations
├── flow.py                    # PocketFlow flow definitions  
├── utils/
│   ├── call_llm.py           # If LLM components needed
│   └── [domain_utils].py     # Domain-specific utilities
├── schemas/
│   ├── requests.py           # Pydantic models
│   └── responses.py          # API schemas
├── tests/
│   ├── test_nodes.py         # Node unit tests
│   ├── test_flow.py          # Integration tests
│   └── test_api.py           # API endpoint tests
└── pyproject.toml            # PocketFlow + dependencies
```

## ✅ Success Criteria

The integration is complete when:

### 1. Universal PocketFlow Output
- Every `/execute-tasks` generates PocketFlow-structured code
- No traditional procedural code is generated
- Even simple tasks use Node patterns appropriately

### 2. Design-First Enforcement
- Every `/create-spec` creates `docs/design.md` 
- 8-step methodology is always followed
- Implementation cannot begin without completed design

### 3. Seamless User Experience  
- Users see one unified workflow, not two systems
- Agent OS commands feel natural and guide toward best practices
- No awareness needed of "Agent OS vs PocketFlow" distinction

### 4. Systematic Agent Coordination
- All PocketFlow agents are invoked systematically
- Pattern recognition happens automatically
- Quality validation is built into the workflow

### 5. Graduated Complexity
```
Simple workflows    → Basic Node/Flow patterns
Multi-step processes → Full PocketFlow architecture  
LLM applications    → Complete Agentic Coding methodology
```

## 🛣️ Implementation Roadmap

### Phase 1: Foundation Alignment
- [ ] Modify core Agent OS instructions to always guide toward PocketFlow
- [ ] Ensure `create-spec.md` always creates `docs/design.md`
- [ ] Update `execute-tasks.md` to always generate PocketFlow structure

### Phase 2: Agent Integration
- [ ] Systematically invoke PocketFlow agents in core workflow
- [ ] Ensure pattern-recognizer runs during spec creation
- [ ] Integrate dependency-orchestrator into project setup
- [ ] Use template-validator for all generated code

### Phase 3: Unified Templates
- [ ] Update all file-creator templates to generate PocketFlow structure
- [ ] Remove conditional LLM/AI logic - make PocketFlow universal
- [ ] Create graduated templates for different complexity levels

### Phase 4: Quality Assurance
- [ ] Validation scripts ensure PocketFlow output
- [ ] End-to-end testing of unified workflow  
- [ ] Documentation reflects unified approach

## 🎯 Key Principles

1. **Agent OS = Interface, PocketFlow = Implementation**
2. **Design-First is Universal** (not just for LLM projects)
3. **One Framework, Not Two** (seamless integration)
4. **Excellence by Default** (best practices built-in)
5. **Graduated Complexity** (simple to advanced, all using PocketFlow)

---

## 📈 Success Metrics

- **100% PocketFlow Output**: Every generated project follows PocketFlow patterns
- **Zero Traditional Code**: No procedural code generated by the framework
- **Universal Design Documents**: Every project has completed `docs/design.md`
- **Seamless UX**: Users don't distinguish between "Agent OS" and "PocketFlow"
- **Quality Applications**: Generated projects are maintainable, testable, scalable

*This mission statement serves as the north star for completing the Agent OS + PocketFlow integration. Every technical decision should be evaluated against these criteria to ensure we achieve true unification rather than parallel coexistence.*
