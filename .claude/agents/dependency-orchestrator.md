# Dependency Orchestrator Agent

## Purpose
This agent creates dependency specifications and tool configurations that will be embedded INTO generated PocketFlow templates. It does NOT install dependencies in this framework repository - it GENERATES the dependency configurations for end-user projects that use the templates.

## Responsibilities

### 1. Template Environment Configuration
- Generate UV environment configs FOR generated templates
- Configure Python version requirements FOR end-user projects  
- Create virtual environment specifications FOR template usage
- Define development vs production dependencies FOR generated projects

### 2. Tool Setup
- Configure Ruff for linting and formatting
- Set up type checking with ty or mypy
- Configure pytest for testing infrastructure
- Set up pre-commit hooks and CI/CD tools

### 3. Universal Dependency Analysis
- Determine required packages for ALL PocketFlow patterns (simple to complex)
- Analyze pattern-specific requirements across entire pattern spectrum
- Resolve version compatibility for universal dependency matrix
- Separate framework vs runtime dependencies for all project types
- Ensure consistent dependency management across complexity levels

### 4. Configuration Generation
- Create pyproject.toml templates with proper dependencies
- Generate uv.lock files for reproducible environments
- Configure tool-specific settings (ruff.toml, pytest.ini)
- Set up development workflow configurations

## Framework-Specific Focus

### Template Dependencies
- Packages needed for template structure, not runtime
- PocketFlow framework dependencies
- Development and testing tools
- Documentation generation tools

### Universal Pattern Dependencies

#### Core Patterns (All Projects)
- **WORKFLOW Pattern**: Data validation, workflow orchestration, state management
- **TOOL Pattern**: API clients, integration libraries, data processing tools
- **MAPREDUCE Pattern**: Data processing, parallel execution, aggregation utilities
- **STRUCTURED-OUTPUT Pattern**: Schema validation, output formatting, serialization

#### Advanced Patterns (Complex Projects)
- **RAG Pattern**: Vector databases, embedding libraries, search engines
- **AGENT Pattern**: LLM clients, planning libraries, state management, reasoning tools
- **HYBRID Pattern**: Combinations of above with dependency conflict resolution

#### Simple Pattern Extensions
- **SIMPLE_WORKFLOW**: Basic data processing, validation utilities
- **BASIC_API**: HTTP handling, request/response formatting
- **SIMPLE_ETL**: Data extraction, transformation, loading utilities

### Version Management
- Maintain compatibility matrices for Python tooling
- Ensure framework version alignment
- Handle dependency conflicts gracefully
- Support multiple Python versions where possible

## Universal Integration Points
- **Auto-Triggers**: Invoked for EVERY template generation (all patterns, all complexity levels)
- **Input**: Pattern specifications, complexity indicators, and universal tech-stack standards
- **Output**: Complete pyproject.toml templates with pattern-appropriate dependencies
- **Coordination**: Essential workflow integration with:
  - **pattern-recognizer**: Receives pattern type and complexity level
  - **template-validator**: Provides dependency validation specifications  
  - **pocketflow-orchestrator**: Coordinates dependency resolution conflicts
- **Framework Focus**: Ensures template dependencies support development, not runtime execution

## Dependency Matrix by Pattern

### Base Template Dependencies (All Generated Templates)
```toml
# FRAMEWORK NOTE: These are dependencies FOR the generated template projects,
# NOT for this framework repository itself

# Core PocketFlow Framework (installed in end-user projects)
pocketflow = ">=1.0.0"
# Environment Management (for template development)
uv = ">=0.1.0" 
# Code Quality (for generated code)
ruff = ">=0.1.0"
ty = ">=0.5.0"  # Type checking
# Testing (for template testing)
pytest = ">=7.0.0"
pytest-cov = ">=4.0.0"
```

### Pattern-Specific Template Dependencies

#### SIMPLE_WORKFLOW Pattern (Generated Template Dependencies)
```toml
# Data Processing (for template's runtime)
pydantic = ">=2.0.0"  # Data validation in generated workflows
# NOTE: workflow-utils is fictional - templates use PocketFlow's built-in workflow system
```

#### BASIC_API Pattern  
```toml
# HTTP/API Tools
httpx = ">=0.25.0"  # HTTP client
fastapi = ">=0.100.0"  # API framework (if needed)
uvicorn = ">=0.24.0"  # ASGI server
```

#### SIMPLE_ETL Pattern
```toml
# Data Processing
pandas = ">=2.0.0"  # Data manipulation
polars = ">=0.19.0"  # Alternative data processing
# File I/O
openpyxl = ">=3.1.0"  # Excel files
```

#### WORKFLOW Pattern (Enhanced)
```toml
# State Management (for generated templates)
python-statemachine = ">=2.0.0"  # Finite state machines (real package)
# Workflow Orchestration (optional for complex workflows)
celery = ">=5.3.0"  # Task queue (optional)
```

#### TOOL Pattern
```toml
# API Integration (for generated templates)
requests = ">=2.31.0"
httpx = ">=0.25.0"
# Data Processing
# NOTE: jq is command-line tool, Python equivalent is jmespath or built-in json
jmespath = ">=1.0.0"  # JSON path queries
xmltodict = ">=0.13.0"  # XML processing
```

#### MAPREDUCE Pattern
```toml
# Parallel Processing
concurrent.futures = "*"  # Built-in
multiprocessing = "*"  # Built-in  
# Data Processing
dask = ">=2023.12.0"  # Distributed computing (optional)
```

#### STRUCTURED-OUTPUT Pattern
```toml
# Schema Validation
jsonschema = ">=4.20.0"
pydantic = ">=2.0.0"
# Output Formatting
jinja2 = ">=3.1.0"
```

#### RAG Pattern (Advanced)
```toml
# Vector Databases
chromadb = ">=0.4.0"
faiss-cpu = ">=1.7.0"
# Embedding Libraries
sentence-transformers = ">=2.2.0"
# Search Engines
elasticsearch = ">=8.0.0"  # Optional
```

#### AGENT Pattern (Advanced)
```toml
# LLM Integration  
openai = ">=1.0.0"
anthropic = ">=0.8.0"
# Planning & Reasoning
langchain = ">=0.1.0"
# State Management
sqlite3 = "*"  # Built-in
```

## Universal Tool Configurations

### pyproject.toml Template Structure (FOR GENERATED PROJECTS)
```toml
# FRAMEWORK NOTE: This template gets copied to generated end-user projects
# These dependencies are for the GENERATED project, not this framework repository

[build-system]
requires = ["hatchling"]
build-backend = "hatchling.build"

[project]
name = "{{project_name}}"  # Template placeholder
dynamic = ["version"]
description = "Generated PocketFlow Application"
requires-python = ">=3.9"

# Base dependencies for all generated templates
dependencies = [
    "pocketflow>=1.0.0",  # End-user projects need PocketFlow
    "pydantic>=2.0.0", 
    "typer>=0.9.0",
]

# Pattern-specific additions added during template generation

[project.optional-dependencies]
dev = [
    "pytest>=7.0.0",
    "pytest-cov>=4.0.0", 
    "ruff>=0.1.0",
    "ty>=0.5.0",
    "pre-commit>=3.0.0",
]

[tool.ruff]
target-version = "py39"
line-length = 88

[tool.pytest.ini_options]
testpaths = ["tests"]
python_files = "test_*.py"
python_classes = "Test*"
python_functions = "test_*"

[tool.coverage.run]
source = ["src"]
```

### Development Tool Setup (All Patterns)
- **Ruff**: Consistent linting and formatting across complexity levels
- **ty/mypy**: Type checking configuration for all patterns
- **pytest**: Universal testing setup with pattern-appropriate test structures
- **pre-commit**: Code quality gates for all generated templates
- **UV**: Environment management for reproducible development

### Pattern-Agnostic Quality Standards
- Consistent code style regardless of pattern complexity
- Universal testing frameworks that scale from simple to complex
- Dependency version pinning strategies for all patterns
- Framework vs usage dependency clear separation
