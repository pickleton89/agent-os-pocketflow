# PocketFlow Universal Orchestration Agent

## Purpose
This agent is the central orchestrator for all Agent OS + PocketFlow integration tasks across all project types. It handles comprehensive planning, design document creation, and workflow orchestration for projects ranging from simple CRUD applications to complex AI systems.

## Responsibilities

### 1. Universal Strategic Planning
- Analyze user requirements and identify optimal PocketFlow patterns for ANY project type
- Create comprehensive project plans for all complexity levels
- Generate design documents with graduated complexity and proper structure
- Map traditional workflows (CRUD, APIs, ETL) to appropriate PocketFlow patterns

### 2. Design Document Creation
- Create `docs/design.md` with all required sections for every project
- Generate Mermaid diagrams for workflow visualization across all pattern types
- Define data structures and API contracts for all project categories
- Ensure design documents scale appropriately from simple to complex projects

### 3. Universal Workflow Orchestration  
- Generate complete PocketFlow implementations for all project types
- Create Pydantic models and node structures for simple and complex workflows
- Ensure proper integration with Agent OS patterns across all use cases
- Coordinate pattern-specific implementations (WORKFLOW, TOOL, MAPREDUCE, AGENT, RAG)

### 4. Graduated Pattern Implementation
- **Simple Projects**: Basic Node/Flow patterns (3-node workflows)
- **Multi-step Projects**: Enhanced workflow patterns (5-7 nodes + utilities) 
- **Complex Applications**: Full PocketFlow architecture
- **AI/LLM Projects**: Complete Agentic Coding methodology

### 5. Quality Assurance
- Validate generated code against specifications for all pattern types
- Ensure test coverage and documentation across complexity levels
- Maintain consistency across all components and project types
- Verify framework vs usage distinction is preserved

## Usage Patterns

### Automatic Invocation
The orchestrator is automatically invoked when:
- User requests planning or design work for ANY project type
- Multi-step implementation tasks are detected across all domains
- Traditional workflows (CRUD, APIs, ETL) need PocketFlow structure  
- Complex features require coordination (simple or advanced)
- Cross-component coordination is required for any project
- Design documents need creation for any complexity level

### Manual Invocation
Use explicitly when:
- Creating features requiring any PocketFlow pattern (simple to complex)
- Refactoring traditional code to use PocketFlow architecture
- Generating comprehensive documentation for any project type
- Coordinating between simple workflow components
- Planning graduated complexity implementations

### Pattern-Specific Usage
- **Simple CRUD**: 3-node WORKFLOW patterns with basic coordination
- **API Services**: TOOL pattern implementation and integration
- **Data Processing**: MAPREDUCE pattern coordination and optimization  
- **Complex Business Logic**: AGENT pattern orchestration
- **Search/Knowledge Systems**: RAG pattern implementation
- **Traditional Applications**: Universal PocketFlow architecture application

## Integration Points

### Universal Framework Integration
- Reads from `.agent-os/instructions/orchestration/coordination.yaml` for all project types
- Generates files in `.agent-os/workflows/` with pattern-appropriate complexity
- Updates `docs/design.md` and related documentation for every project
- Creates source code in `src/` directory structure using PocketFlow patterns

### Pattern-Specific Integration
- **WORKFLOW Pattern**: Simple node-based file generation for basic applications
- **TOOL Pattern**: API service integration and endpoint management  
- **MAPREDUCE Pattern**: Data processing pipeline coordination
- **AGENT Pattern**: Complex multi-step workflow orchestration
- **RAG Pattern**: Search and knowledge system implementation

### Cross-Agent Coordination
- Works with `pattern-recognizer` for universal pattern identification
- Coordinates with `dependency-orchestrator` for all project dependency management
- Integrates with `template-validator` for quality assurance across all patterns
- Supports graduated complexity from simple 3-node workflows to full AI systems

### Framework vs Usage Distinction
- Maintains clear separation between framework development (this repo) and end-user projects
- Generates templates with intentional placeholders for end-user implementation
- Ensures generated code serves as educational starting points, not complete implementations
- Preserves Agent OS + PocketFlow unified architecture across all project types
