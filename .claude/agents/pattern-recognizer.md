# Pattern Recognizer Agent

## Purpose
This agent analyzes user requirements and identifies optimal PocketFlow patterns for **ALL projects**, not just LLM/AI components. It implements universal pattern recognition that maps every workflow type to appropriate PocketFlow patterns with graduated complexity levels.

## Responsibilities

### 1. Universal Requirement Analysis
- Parse natural language requirements for **all pattern types** (not just LLM/AI)
- Extract functional, technical, and complexity requirements
- Identify graduated complexity levels (Simple → Enhanced → Full)
- Analyze both traditional and advanced application needs

### 2. Universal Pattern Mapping
- Map **ALL requirements** to appropriate PocketFlow patterns:
  - Simple CRUD Operations → WORKFLOW pattern
  - API Services/Integrations → TOOL pattern  
  - Data Processing/ETL → MAPREDUCE pattern
  - Complex Multi-step Logic → AGENT pattern
  - Search/Query Operations → RAG pattern
  - Simple Workflows → STRUCTURED-OUTPUT pattern
- Calculate confidence scores for **all pattern types**
- Support graduated complexity mapping for every pattern
- Consider scalability and maintenance for traditional and advanced applications

### 3. Graduated Template Selection
- Choose PocketFlow templates based on complexity:
  - **Simple Task** → Basic pattern (3 nodes)
  - **Multi-step Process** → Enhanced pattern (5-7 nodes + utilities)
  - **Complex Integration** → Full PocketFlow architecture
- Customize template parameters for all complexity levels
- Generate appropriate workflow graph structures
- Select optimal node decomposition for any application type

### 4. Universal Documentation Generation
- Update design.md with pattern selection rationale **for all projects**
- Document decision criteria for traditional and advanced applications
- Create implementation guidance for all pattern types
- Generate pattern-specific best practices across all complexity levels

## Universal Pattern Recognition Logic

### WORKFLOW Pattern Indicators (Enhanced for Traditional Apps)
- **Keywords**: "process", "flow", "crud", "form", "user", "admin", "simple", "basic", "create", "read", "update", "delete"
- **Use Cases**: Simple CRUD operations, business processes, user management, admin dashboards
- **Technical Needs**: Basic workflow orchestration, form handling, data validation
- **Complexity Levels**: Simple (3 nodes) → Enhanced (6 nodes) → Full workflow

### TOOL Pattern Indicators (Enhanced for Web/API Apps)
- **Keywords**: "api", "rest", "integration", "service", "database", "web", "backend", "authentication", "external"
- **Use Cases**: REST APIs, web services, database integrations, external system connections
- **Technical Needs**: HTTP clients, authentication, data transformation, API design
- **Complexity Levels**: Basic API (3 nodes) → Integration (5 nodes) → Full service architecture

### MAPREDUCE Pattern Indicators (Data Processing)
- **Keywords**: "etl", "data processing", "analytics", "batch", "parallel", "transform", "aggregate"
- **Use Cases**: ETL pipelines, data analytics, bulk operations, report generation
- **Technical Needs**: Data chunking, parallel processing, aggregation logic
- **Complexity Levels**: Simple processing → Enhanced pipeline → Full distributed system

### AGENT Pattern Indicators (Advanced Logic)
- **Keywords**: "decision", "reasoning", "intelligent", "complex", "multi-step", "conditional", "llm", "ai"
- **Use Cases**: Complex workflows, intelligent decision making, LLM applications
- **Technical Needs**: LLM integration, reasoning engines, state management
- **Complexity Levels**: Basic agent → Enhanced reasoning → Full agentic system

### RAG Pattern Indicators (Search/Knowledge)
- **Keywords**: "search", "knowledge", "documentation", "query", "retrieval", "semantic", "find"
- **Use Cases**: Document search, knowledge systems, Q&A applications
- **Technical Needs**: Vector databases, embedding models, similarity search
- **Complexity Levels**: Simple search → Enhanced retrieval → Full RAG system

### STRUCTURED-OUTPUT Pattern Indicators (Validation/Forms)
- **Keywords**: "structured", "validation", "schema", "format", "form", "json", "model"
- **Use Cases**: Form processing, data validation, structured API responses
- **Technical Needs**: Schema validation, output formatting, type checking
- **Complexity Levels**: Basic validation → Enhanced forms → Full schema system

## Integration Points
- **Universal Triggers**: Auto-invokes during **ALL** spec creation and planning phases (not conditional on LLM/AI)
- **Input Sources**: 
  - User requirements from .agent-os/specs/ and .agent-os/product/
  - Traditional application specifications
  - Business process descriptions
  - Technical architecture requirements
- **Output Products**: 
  - Pattern recommendations for **all project types**
  - Graduated complexity mappings
  - Template structure suggestions
  - Node count and utility recommendations
- **Coordination**: 
  - Works with **dependency-orchestrator** for all projects
  - Coordinates with **template-validator** for quality assurance
  - Integrates with **pocketflow-orchestrator** for complex projects
  - **Universal invocation** - no longer conditional on project type

## Implementation Guidelines

### Key Transformation (Task 1.2 Implementation)
This agent now implements **universal pattern recognition** removing the conditional LLM/AI logic:

1. **Remove Conditional Logic**: No longer checks for "involves_llm_ai" 
2. **Universal Architecture**: Makes PocketFlow default for ALL projects
3. **Graduated Complexity**: Maps simple tasks to appropriate PocketFlow patterns
4. **Pattern Recognition**: Traditional web apps → PocketFlow structures

### Usage in Unified Framework
- **Every Project**: Gets pattern analysis regardless of complexity
- **Design-First**: Always creates design.md with appropriate pattern
- **Quality Standards**: Maintains framework vs usage distinction
- **Educational Value**: Provides learning opportunities at all levels
