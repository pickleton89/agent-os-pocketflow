### 2. PocketFlow Dependencies
- Required Python packages installed
- PocketFlow patterns identified
- Workflow structure defined

### 3. Implementation Dependencies
- Source code structure matches design
- Tests exist for all components
- Documentation is up to date

## Validation Commands
```bash
# Validate design document
