## [1.10.10] - 2025-08-15

### Fixed
- **Orchestration Validator Path Mismatch** - Fixed critical path issues preventing proper validation of PocketFlow orchestration integration
  - **Root Cause**: Validator was looking for files in wrong locations - expected `.agent-os/agents/` and `.agent-os/templates/` but actual locations are `.claude/agents/` and `templates/`
  - **Solution**: Updated OrchestrationValidator class to use correct paths by adding claude_path and templates_path properties
  - **Implementation**: Modified `.agent-os/scripts/validate-orchestration.py` to reference actual file locations
  - **Impact**: Template Files validation now passes, orchestrator agent file properly located, eliminates core path mismatch preventing validation
  - **Validation**: Confirmed Template Files test now passes (was failing before due to wrong template path)

## [1.10.9] - 2025-08-15

### Fixed
- **Async Test Detection Logic** - Fixed ineffective async node detection in workflow validation script
  - **Root Cause**: Validation script was checking for "AsyncNode" in workflow path string instead of analyzing actual file content
  - **Solution**: Added `_has_async_nodes()` method with regex pattern matching to detect class inheritance like `class SomeClass(AsyncNode)`
  - **Implementation**: Enhanced `.agent-os/scripts/validate-generation.py:332-346` to read and analyze `nodes.py` file content
  - **Impact**: Validation now correctly identifies workflows with AsyncNode implementations and warns about missing async test methods

  - **Impact**: Resolves NameError runtime exception when generated workflows try to timestamp request data in API endpoints
  - **Files Modified**: `.agent-os/workflows/generator.py` - Added datetime import to FastAPI router generation template

## [1.10.6] - 2025-08-15

### Fixed
- **PocketFlow Generator Package Structure** - Resolved critical issue with relative imports in generated test files
  - **Root Cause**: Generated test files used relative imports like `from ..nodes import` but `save_workflow` method didn't create `__init__.py` files, causing `ModuleNotFoundError` when tests tried to run
  - **Solution**: Enhanced `save_workflow` method in `.agent-os/workflows/generator.py:863-891` to automatically create proper Python package scaffolding
  - **Implementation**: Added logic to track all directories created during file generation and create empty `__init__.py` files in subdirectories (tests, schemas, utils, docs, root)
  - **Immediate Fix**: Created missing `__init__.py` files for existing `testcontentanalyzer` workflow to restore functionality
  - **Impact**: All generated PocketFlow workflows now have proper Python package structure, enabling relative imports in tests to work correctly

### Technical Details
- **Files Modified**: `.agent-os/workflows/generator.py` (save_workflow method), created 5 `__init__.py` files for testcontentanalyzer workflow
