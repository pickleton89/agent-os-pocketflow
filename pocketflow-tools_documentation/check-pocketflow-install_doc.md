How does the check-pocketflow-install.py file work?

⏺ The check-pocketflow-install.py file is a dependency validation and
  installation utility for PocketFlow projects. Here's how it works:

  Core Purpose

  Validates that end-user projects have the necessary dependencies to run
  PocketFlow workflows generated by the Agent OS framework.

  Main Functions

  1. Python Version Check (check_python_version)
  - Ensures Python 3.12+ compatibility

  2. Project Structure Validation (check_project_structure)
  - Checks for core PocketFlow files: pyproject.toml, flow.py, nodes.py,
  schemas/models.py
  - Determines if the current directory is a valid PocketFlow project

  3. Package Validation (check_package)
  - Uses importlib to check if packages are installed
  - Extracts version information from package __version__ attributes

  4. Security-First Installation (install_package)
  - Validates package names against PyPI naming conventions
  (pocketflow-tools/check-pocketflow-install.py:43)
  - Prevents installation of malicious package names
  - Tries uv add first (preferred), falls back to pip install
  - 5-minute timeout protection against hanging installs

  5. Dependency Categories
  - Required: PocketFlow core, FastAPI, Pydantic, testing frameworks
  - Optional: Development tools (ruff, ty), API clients (openai, anthropic),
  vector databases

  Usage Modes

  Check-Only Mode:
  python check-pocketflow-install.py
  - Reports installation status with visual indicators (✅❌⚠️)
  - Provides installation commands but doesn't install

  Auto-Install Mode:
  python check-pocketflow-install.py --install
  - Automatically installs missing required dependencies
  - Reports success/failure for each package
  - Updates final summary based on installation results

  Output Format

  - Structured sections: Python version → Project structure → Required deps →
  Optional deps → Summary
  - Exit codes: 0 if all required deps present, 1 if missing required
  dependencies
  - Clear guidance on manual installation commands using uv or pip

  This utility is deployed to ~/.agent-os/pocketflow-tools/ during base
  installation and copied as a shim to generated projects for local dependency
  validation.

How does it actually work in the context of this project?

⏺ The check-pocketflow-install.py file works differently in the framework 
  development context (this repository) versus its intended usage context
  (end-user PocketFlow projects).

  In This Framework Repository Context

  Current Reality:
  - This repository IS the framework itself, not a PocketFlow project
  - Running check-pocketflow-install.py here would show:
    - ❌ Missing core PocketFlow files (flow.py, nodes.py, schemas/models.py)
    - ❌ Missing PocketFlow package (not installed as dependency)
    - Warning: "This doesn't appear to be a PocketFlow project"

  Framework Role:
  - The file exists here as a template/tool that gets deployed to target
  locations
  - It's part of the framework's tooling, not meant to validate the framework
  itself
  - Gets copied to ~/.agent-os/pocketflow-tools/ during base installation via
  setup/base.sh

  In End-User Project Context (Its Intended Use)

  Deployment Process:
  1. Base Installation: setup/base.sh copies this file to
  ~/.agent-os/pocketflow-tools/
  2. Project Generation: The generator creates a shim in each generated project
   that points to the base installation
  3. Project Usage: End-users run it in their PocketFlow project directory

  Validation Flow:
  # In a generated PocketFlow project
  python check-pocketflow-install.py

  Would check for:
  - ✅ flow.py (generated workflow implementation)
  - ✅ nodes.py (custom PocketFlow nodes)
  - ✅ schemas/models.py (Pydantic data models)
  - ✅ PocketFlow package (installed via uv add pocketflow)

  Framework vs Usage Distinction

  This exemplifies the key principle from the CLAUDE.md instructions:

  FRAMEWORK DEVELOPMENT (this repository):
  - Contains tools that generate/validate PocketFlow projects
  - Missing PocketFlow dependencies here is BY DESIGN

  FRAMEWORK USAGE (end-user projects):  
  - Where this checker actually validates working PocketFlow installations
  - Where the dependencies it checks for are actually required

  The file validates end-user projects, not the framework that creates them.
  Running it in this repository would correctly report "not a PocketFlow
  project" because this repository develops the framework, it doesn't use
  PocketFlow as an application dependency.

How does the check-pocketflow-install.py get called or activated for use?

⏺ Based on my analysis, here's how check-pocketflow-install.py gets activated
  for use:

  Activation Flow

  1. Base Installation (via setup/base.sh)

  # User runs base installation
  curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/.../setup.sh | bash

  The setup script:
  - Copies pocketflow-tools/check-pocketflow-install.py →
  ~/.agent-os/pocketflow-tools/
  - Makes it available system-wide for all PocketFlow projects

  2. Project Generation (via Generator)

  When the generator creates a new PocketFlow project, it creates a shim file
  check-install.py:

  # Generated shim in each PocketFlow project
  from pathlib import Path

  def main():
      """Run the main installation checker."""
      # Path to the main checker in Agent OS
      agent_os_checker = Path.home() / ".agent-os" / "pocketflow-tools" /
  "check-pocketflow-install.py"

      if not agent_os_checker.exists():
          print("❌ Agent OS + PocketFlow installation checker not found.")
          return 1

      # Execute the main checker
      exec(open(agent_os_checker).read())

  3. End-User Activation

  In a generated PocketFlow project, users can run:

  # Via the generated shim
  python check-install.py [--install]

  # Or directly from base installation  
  python ~/.agent-os/pocketflow-tools/check-pocketflow-install.py [--install]

  4. Project Installation (via setup/project.sh)

  When installing Agent OS into existing projects:
  - Copies the tool from base → .agent-os/pocketflow-tools/ (project-local
  copy)

  Key Design Principles

  1. Single Source of Truth: One canonical checker in
  ~/.agent-os/pocketflow-tools/
  2. Smart Routing: Generated shims redirect to the base installation
  3. Local Copies: Project installations get local copies for offline use
  4. Automatic Discovery: No complex PATH setup - just python check-install.py

  The activation model ensures that every PocketFlow project can easily
  validate its dependencies, while the framework maintains a centralized,
  updateable version of the checker.
