How does the status_reporter.py file work?

⏺ The status_reporter.py file is a comprehensive status tracking and reporting
  utility for PocketFlow operations. Here's how it works:

  Core Components

  StatusReporter Class (lines 17-303)

  Main Purpose: Provides enhanced progress tracking, logging, and user feedback
   for PocketFlow workflow operations.

  Key Features:
  - Progress Tracking: Visual progress bars with percentage completion and
  step-by-step status
  - Persistent Storage: Saves status to /tmp/{workflow_name}_status.json and
  logs to /tmp/{workflow_name}_operation.log
  - Multi-level Logging: Supports errors, warnings, and info messages with
  timestamps
  - File Tracking: Records files created during operations with metadata

  Core Methods:
  - start_step(): Displays progress bar and updates current step status:203-211
  - log_error/warning/info(): Structured logging with console output and
  persistence
  - complete_operation(): Marks workflow completion with comprehensive summary
  - print_status_report(): Detailed status overview with error counts and file
  lists

  ErrorRecoveryManager Class (lines 306-392)

  Purpose: Automated error handling and recovery strategies for common
  PocketFlow failures.

  Recovery Strategies:
  - Pattern Analysis: Falls back to "WORKFLOW" pattern when analysis fails
  - Template Generation: Handles permissions/directory issues with guidance
  - Dependency Setup: Continues operation despite network connectivity issues
  - Validation: Treats validation failures as non-fatal warnings
  - Context Extraction: Uses minimal context fallback

  Usage

  CLI Interface (lines 395-450)

  The file provides a command-line interface for external tools:

  # Initialize status tracking
  python status_reporter.py workflow_name operation init

  # Update step progress
  python status_reporter.py workflow_name operation step 3 "Generating 
  templates"

  # Log errors/complete operations
  python status_reporter.py workflow_name operation error "Template validation 
  failed"
  python status_reporter.py workflow_name operation complete

  Integration Pattern

  Typically used by other PocketFlow tools (like generator.py) to provide user
  feedback during long-running operations like project generation and
  validation.

  The system creates persistent status files that can be monitored across
  processes, making it useful for tracking complex multi-step workflows in the
  Agent OS + PocketFlow framework.

How does it actually work in the context of this project?

⏺ Based on my analysis, here's how status_reporter.py actually works in the
  context of this project:

  Current Reality: StatusReporter is NOT Actually Used

  Key Finding: Despite being a comprehensive 450-line utility,
  status_reporter.py is currently unused in this framework project.

  Evidence:

  - No imports: No other files import or use StatusReporter
  - No CLI usage: No scripts call python status_reporter.py
  - Standalone utility: Exists as a complete tool but isn't integrated

  Intended Design vs Current State

  Intended Usage (based on the code):
  # Progress tracking during workflow generation
  python status_reporter.py my_project generation init
  python status_reporter.py my_project generation step 1 "Analyzing patterns"
  python status_reporter.py my_project generation step 2 "Generating templates"
  python status_reporter.py my_project generation complete

  Current Reality:
  - Template generation happens in pocketflow_tools/generators/ without status
  tracking
  - Tests show simple print statements instead of progress bars
  - No persistent status files are created during actual operations

  Framework Context

  This is typical of Framework Development vs Usage:

  Framework Repository (this repo):
  - StatusReporter is a tool being developed for future use
  - Part of the toolkit that gets deployed to end-user projects
  - Currently exists as unused capability

  End-User Projects (where it would be used):
  - Would get copied to .agent-os/pocketflow-tools/
  - Intended for tracking complex PocketFlow workflow generation
  - Would provide user feedback during long-running template creation

  Integration Gap

  The project has sophisticated status reporting capability but lacks the
  integration layer. The actual template generation system in
  pocketflow_tools/generators/ operates independently without progress
  tracking.

  StatusReporter represents planned infrastructure for better user experience
  that hasn't been connected to the main workflow generation pipeline yet.

How does the status_reporter.py get called or activated for use?

⏺ Based on my analysis, status_reporter.py has multiple potential activation 
  methods, but none are currently being used in this project:

  Activation Methods Built Into the Code

  1. Command Line Interface (status_reporter.py:395-450)

  # Basic usage patterns
  python status_reporter.py <workflow_name> <operation> [action]

  # Initialize tracking
  python status_reporter.py my_project generation init

  # Update progress
  python status_reporter.py my_project generation step 1 "Analyzing 
  requirements"

  # Log errors
  python status_reporter.py my_project generation error "Template validation 
  failed"

  # Complete operation
  python status_reporter.py my_project generation complete

  2. Python Import and Direct Usage

  from status_reporter import StatusReporter

  # Create reporter instance
  reporter = StatusReporter("my_workflow", "template_generation")

  # Set total steps for progress tracking
  reporter.set_total_steps(5)

  # Track progress through steps
  reporter.start_step(1, "Analyzing patterns")
  reporter.log_info("Pattern analysis complete")
  reporter.start_step(2, "Generating templates")

  # Complete the operation
  reporter.complete_operation(success=True, final_message="All templates 
  generated")

  3. Error Recovery Integration

  from status_reporter import StatusReporter, ErrorRecoveryManager

  reporter = StatusReporter("workflow", "operation")
  recovery = ErrorRecoveryManager(reporter)

  # Handle errors with recovery strategies
  success = recovery.handle_error("template_generation_failed", "Permission 
  denied", context)

  Current Activation Reality: NONE

  No Integration Found:
  - Template generators in pocketflow_tools/generators/ don't import
  StatusReporter
  - No shell scripts call the CLI interface
  - No orchestration system activates it
  - Tests don't use it for progress tracking

  Where It SHOULD Be Activated

  During Template Generation (missing integration):

  # In pocketflow_tools/generators/code_generators.py (not implemented)
  from status_reporter import StatusReporter

  def generate_project_structure(project_name: str, pattern: str):
      reporter = StatusReporter(project_name, "generation")
      reporter.set_total_steps(6)

      reporter.start_step(1, "Creating directory structure")
      # ... actual generation logic ...

      reporter.start_step(2, "Generating flow.py")
      # ... code generation ...

      reporter.complete_operation(success=True)

  Via Orchestrator Agent (planned but not implemented):

  The .claude/agents/pocketflow-orchestrator.md agent could activate it, but
  that agent isn't currently invoked by the framework.

  Status: Dormant Infrastructure

  StatusReporter is fully functional but completely unused - it's
  infrastructure waiting for integration. It represents the gap between
  sophisticated capability and practical activation in this framework project.

  To activate it, you would need to:
  1. Import it into the actual generation pipeline
  2. Add CLI calls to shell scripts
  3. Or integrate it into the orchestrator agent system


---

How does the status_reporter.py get called or activated for use?

⏺ Based on my analysis, status_reporter.py is currently NOT activated anywhere
  in this project. Here are the designed activation methods and current
  reality:

  Designed Activation Methods (Unused)

  1. Direct CLI Usage

  python status_reporter.py workflow_name operation action

  2. Python Import Integration

  from status_reporter import StatusReporter
  reporter = StatusReporter("workflow", "operation")

  Current Reality: Zero Activation

  Evidence of non-usage:
  - No imports found in any generator files
  - No CLI calls in any shell scripts
  - No integration in the template generation pipeline
  - Exists as standalone, unused utility

  Where It SHOULD Be Called

  Missing Integration Points:

  1. Template Generation Process (should be but isn't):
  # In pocketflow_tools/generators/ (not implemented)
  reporter = StatusReporter(project_name, "template_generation")
  reporter.set_total_steps(5)
  reporter.start_step(1, "Analyzing patterns")

  2. Setup Scripts (should be but isn't):
  # In setup/project.sh (not implemented)  
  python ~/.agent-os/pocketflow-tools/status_reporter.py project setup init

  3. Orchestrator Agent (planned but inactive):
  The pocketflow-orchestrator agent could activate it but isn't currently
  invoked.

  Status: Dormant Infrastructure

  StatusReporter is complete, functional code that's waiting for integration.
  It's part of the framework toolkit but has no activation pathway in the
  current system.

  To actually use it, you would need to manually:
  1. Import it into generation scripts
  2. Add CLI calls to setup processes
  3. Or activate the orchestrator agent system

  Currently, it exists as unused capability - sophisticated infrastructure
  without practical activation.
