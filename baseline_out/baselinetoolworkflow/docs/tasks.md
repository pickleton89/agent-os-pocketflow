- [ ] 7.7 Verify system reliability under various conditions

**Development Toolchain Validation (Every Phase):**
- Run `uv run ruff check --fix .` for linting
- Run `uv run ruff format .` for code formatting
- Run `uv run ty check` for type checking
- Run `pytest` for all tests
- Verify all checks pass before proceeding to next phase

## Generated Files Summary

The following files have been generated and need completion:

### Core Files ✓
- `docs/design.md` - Design document (review and complete)
- `schemas/models.py` - Pydantic models (review and extend)
- `nodes.py` - PocketFlow nodes (implement logic)
- `flow.py` - Flow assembly (review connections)

### Utility Files ✓

- `utils/http_client.py` - Make HTTP requests to external APIs
- `utils/data_mapper.py` - Map data between different schemas

### FastAPI Files ✓
- `main.py` - FastAPI application
