# TestContentAnalyzer - Framework Validation Example

## Purpose

This directory contains a **generated PocketFlow template with TODO placeholders** that serves as:

1. **Framework Validation**: Demonstrates that the Agent OS + PocketFlow framework generator produces proper template structure with TODO placeholders
2. **Template Example**: Shows end-users what the framework generates as starting points for implementation
3. **Testing Infrastructure**: Used by `test-full-generation.py` to validate template generation quality
4. **Documentation Example**: Provides concrete example referenced in framework documentation

## Framework Context

**⚠️ IMPORTANT**: This is **GENERATED CODE** created by the framework's template generator, not hand-written application code.

### Framework Repository Role
- **This repository IS** the Agent OS + PocketFlow framework itself
- **This directory contains** a template example with TODO placeholders that the framework generates for end-user projects
- **This is NOT** a violation of framework boundaries - it's validation infrastructure

### Generated vs Hand-Written
- All files in this directory are **outputs** of the framework's code generation system
- The working PocketFlow imports (`from pocketflow import Flow`, `from pocketflow import Node`) are **intentional** - they show what end-users will get
- The TODO placeholders demonstrate the framework's design principle: provide starting points, not finished implementations
- Missing implementations in TODO sections are **features, not bugs** - they guide end-user development

## Usage in Framework

### Referenced By:
- `README.md:229` - "Complete generated PocketFlow app" 
- `test-full-generation.py` - Validates generated file structure and content
- `docs/architecture/code-pointers.md` - Documentation examples

### Validation Role:
- Tests that generator creates syntactically correct Python code with proper structure
- Verifies PocketFlow imports and class usage work correctly  
- Ensures generated FastAPI applications have proper template structure
- Validates that TODO placeholders are meaningful and guide implementation

## For End-Users

When you run the framework generator on your own project, you'll get a similar template structure with:
- PocketFlow flows and nodes with TODO placeholders for implementation
- FastAPI web service structure with proper routing templates
- Pydantic models and schemas with example fields
- Test suite templates ready for customization
- Documentation templates with TODO sections

This example shows the starting point templates the framework provides - you implement the TODO sections to create your working application.
