# Product Documentation Management

## Overview
Product planning documents that define your project's vision, architecture, and development roadmap. These documents form the foundation of the design-first methodology and evolve throughout your project lifecycle.

The product directory contains the core strategic documents that guide all development decisions. These documents are automatically generated during product planning and continuously refined as your project evolves.

## Document Standards

### Core Product Documents

#### **mission.md** - Product Vision and Goals
- **Purpose**: Defines project vision, target users, and success criteria
- **Creation**: Generated during `/plan-product` command execution
- **Evolution**: Updated when product strategy shifts or market requirements change
- **Dependencies**: Foundation for all other product planning documents

#### **tech-stack.md** - Technology Choices and Rationale
- **Purpose**: Documents technology decisions with justification and alternatives
- **Creation**: Generated during product planning with modern Python defaults
- **Evolution**: Updated when adding new technologies or changing architectural decisions
- **Dependencies**: Influences PocketFlow pattern selection and implementation approaches

#### **roadmap.md** - 5-Phase Development Plan
- **Purpose**: Structured development timeline with PocketFlow pattern tagging
- **Creation**: Generated during product planning with design-first methodology integration
- **Evolution**: Updated after major milestones and during phase transitions
- **Dependencies**: Drives feature specification priority and resource allocation

#### **design.md** - Architectural Blueprints
- **Purpose**: Comprehensive system architecture with PocketFlow integration patterns
- **Creation**: Initially generated during product planning, extended during feature specification
- **Evolution**: Continuously expanded with each `/create-spec` command execution
- **Dependencies**: Must exist before implementation phase begins

#### **pre-flight.md** - Development Readiness Checklist
- **Purpose**: Validates project readiness for development phases
- **Creation**: Generated during product planning with PocketFlow-specific validations
- **Evolution**: Updated to reflect project-specific readiness requirements
- **Dependencies**: Gates progression from planning to implementation phases

## Document Evolution Guidelines

### Phase-Based Evolution Strategy

#### 1. **Product Planning Phase** (`/plan-product`)
- Start with mission.md during product planning execution
- Generate complete tech-stack.md with technology rationale
- Create initial roadmap.md with 5-phase structure
- Establish design.md architectural foundation
- Generate pre-flight.md development readiness checklist

#### 2. **Feature Specification Phase** (`/create-spec [feature-name]`)
- Expand design.md with feature-specific architectural details
- Update roadmap.md to reflect feature integration timeline
- Extend pre-flight.md with feature-specific readiness requirements
- Maintain cross-references between features and product vision

#### 3. **Implementation Phase** (`/execute-tasks [spec-name]`)
- Validate design.md completeness before allowing implementation
- Update roadmap.md with implementation progress
- Ensure tech-stack.md reflects actual technology usage
- Maintain architectural consistency across all product documents

#### 4. **Quality Assurance Phase**
- Verify product documents reflect implemented functionality
- Update mission.md if product direction evolved during implementation
- Ensure design.md accurately represents current architecture
- Validate roadmap.md alignment with actual development progress

#### 5. **Deployment and Evolution Phase**
- Archive completed roadmap phases
- Plan next development cycles in roadmap.md
- Update design.md with deployment architecture
- Evolve mission.md based on user feedback and market response

### Document Consistency Requirements

#### Cross-Reference Integrity
- All features in design.md must align with mission.md vision
- Technology choices in tech-stack.md must support architectural decisions in design.md
- Roadmap.md phases must reflect realistic implementation of design.md architecture
- Pre-flight.md validations must ensure readiness for design.md implementation

#### Version Synchronization
- Document updates must be coordinated to maintain consistency
- Feature additions require updates across multiple product documents
- Architecture changes must be reflected in all dependent documents
- Timeline changes in roadmap.md must align with design complexity

## Management Best Practices

### Document Ownership and Evolution
- **Human Ownership**: Product strategy decisions remain human-driven
- **Agent Implementation**: Agents extend and implement architectural details
- **Collaborative Evolution**: Documents evolve through human-agent collaboration
- **Design Authority**: Humans maintain architectural decision authority

### Quality Control Standards
- **Architectural Consistency**: All documents must support coherent system design
- **Implementation Feasibility**: Design decisions must be technically achievable
- **Timeline Realism**: Roadmap phases must reflect actual development capacity
- **Vision Alignment**: All technical decisions must support product mission

### Maintenance Workflows
- **Regular Reviews**: Periodic validation of document accuracy and relevance
- **Update Coordination**: Synchronized updates across dependent documents
- **Version Control**: Git-based tracking of document evolution
- **Stakeholder Communication**: Clear communication of document changes

## Cross-References

### Framework Integration
@../instructions/core/plan-product.md - Product planning workflow orchestration
@../instructions/core/create-spec.md - Feature specification integration with product documents
@../standards/pocket-flow.md - PocketFlow pattern integration requirements
@../../specs/ - Feature specifications that extend product architecture

### Document Dependencies
- **mission.md** → All other documents (provides vision foundation)
- **tech-stack.md** → design.md (enables architectural decisions)
- **design.md** → roadmap.md (informs development timeline)
- **roadmap.md** → pre-flight.md (defines readiness requirements)
- **All documents** → Feature specifications (guide implementation decisions)

## Framework vs Application Context

### Product Documents as Framework Output
These product documents are **generated by the framework** for **your specific application**:

- **Framework Role**: Provides templates, validation, and evolution guidelines
- **Application Role**: Contains your specific product vision, technology choices, and architecture
- **Human Role**: Makes strategic and architectural decisions
- **Agent Role**: Implements and extends documents based on human decisions

### Document Customization Boundaries
- **Safe to Customize**: All content within documents (vision, technology choices, timelines)
- **Maintain Structure**: Document format and cross-reference patterns (ensures framework compatibility)
- **Evolution Patterns**: Follow framework-guided evolution workflows (maintains design-first methodology)
- **Integration Points**: Preserve connections to feature specifications and implementation workflows

The product documents bridge strategic planning with technical implementation, ensuring that all development activities align with your product vision while following proven architectural patterns.
